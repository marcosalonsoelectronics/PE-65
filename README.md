Material of video PE #65: Effect of Sampling Period on the Closed-Loop Response of DC-DC Converters

Available at: https://youtu.be/bypu6wQF3qk

In this video we study the effect of the sampling period on the dynamic response of closed-loop DC-DC converters with digital control. Qspice simulations are used to illustrate all the ideas.
